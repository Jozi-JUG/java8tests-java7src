This is a simple project that demonstrates how to write Testing code
in Java 8 while maintaining your general Source code in Java 7.
Additionally, we go beyond typical JUnit tests and introduce `specification based testing`.

To run this example, part of it will need `lambda-spec`[1] GitHub project that isn't in any of the maven repositories as of this writing.
Clone the lambda-spec repo and install it into your local maven repo. Then you can go ahead and run the maven `compile`/`test` commands for `java8tests-java7src`.
